# Nexus Editor Roadmap

This document maps every planned feature to **package ownership / priority / status / OpenSpec linkage**.

[中文版](./ROADMAP.zh.md)

- Any item added to the roadmap should be registered here as one row first, then decide whether it needs an OpenSpec proposal.
- Status values: `planned` / `in-progress` / `blocked` / `done` (merged to `main`) / `dropped`.
- Priority: `P0` (current iteration) / `P1` (next) / `P2` (mid-term) / `P3` (long-term).
- "Needs OpenSpec" — whether the item must go through `openspec/changes/` (see `CONTRIBUTING.md` §3.1).

## 1. Toolbar / Text Editing

| # | Feature | Package | Priority | Status | Needs OpenSpec | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Multi-line list toggle (ordered / unordered) | `plugin-toolbar` + `core` commands | P1 | done | No | Landed with `getSelectedText()` / `replaceRange()` — see `openspec/changes/add-selection-api` |
| 12 | Advanced toolbar (emoji picker / table tools / color picker) | `plugin-toolbar` | P2 | planned | Yes | Introduces widgets — split into 3 sub-proposals |

## 2. Search / Commands

| # | Feature | Package | Priority | Status | Needs OpenSpec | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2  | Whole-word matching | `plugin-search` | P1 | done | No | `wholeWord` option via `buildSearchPattern` with `\b` boundaries |
| 15 | Regex search | `plugin-search` | P1 | done | No | `regexp` option landed alongside whole-word; invalid-regex guarded |
| 16 | Command / search history | `plugin-search` + `plugin-slash` | P2 | done | Yes | Host-injected storage (no implicit localStorage) — `add-search-query-history` + `add-slash-recent-command-history` |
| 17 | Fuzzy search | `plugin-search` | P2 | planned | No | Evaluate fzf-like algorithm vs. third-party lib; needs backtracking matcher |
| 3  | Slash command sorting + limit | `plugin-slash` | P0 | done | Yes | Landed alongside the floating menu UI — see `openspec/changes/add-slash-menu-ui` |
| 27 | Slash command floating menu UI | `plugin-slash` + `electron-demo` | P0 | done | Yes | `createSlashMenuUI(editor, options)` — see `openspec/changes/add-slash-menu-ui` |

## 3. Core Editor

| # | Feature | Package | Priority | Status | Needs OpenSpec | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | `getSelectedText()` API | `core` | P0 | done | No | Plus atomic `replaceRange()` (single undo entry) — see `openspec/changes/add-selection-api` |
| 6 | Multi-cursor / multi-selection | `core` | P1 | done | Yes | `openspec/changes/add-core-multi-cursor` — opt-in `multiCursor` config; live-preview reveal + table checks verified by regression tests |
| 7 | AST enhancement / Markdown extensions | `core` + `preset-gfm` | P2 | planned | Yes | Affects serialization and every AST-dependent plugin |
| 8 | Undo / redo grouping | `plugin-history` | P1 | planned | No | Coordinate with table's `tableEditingCount`; consolidate competing impls before merge |
| 30 | HTML clipboard → Markdown paste | `core` | P1 | in-progress | Yes | `openspec/changes/add-html-markdown-paste` — opt-out via `htmlPaste: false` |

## 4. Plugin System

Plugin-platform documentation (Chinese): [native API](./plugins/native-plugin-api.zh.md) · [Obsidian migration matrix](./plugins/obsidian-migration.zh.md) · [legacy migration](./plugins/legacy-plugin-migration.zh.md) · [events and security](./plugins/security-and-events.zh.md). The completed design and acceptance record is archived as [`add-plugin-platform-api`](../openspec/changes/archive/2026-08-13-add-plugin-platform-api/).

| # | Feature | Package | Priority | Status | Needs OpenSpec | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9  | Widget API standardization | `core` | P1 | planned | Yes | Existing widgets hit many pitfalls (see CLAUDE.md); spec first |
| 10 | Plugin event bus | `core` | P2 | planned | Yes | Affects every existing `plugin-*` |
| 11 | Plugin hot-reload | `core` | P3 | planned | Yes | Dev mode only; depends on #9 |

## 5. UI / Preview / Keymap

| # | Feature | Package | Priority | Status | Needs OpenSpec | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 13 | Markdown live preview sync scroll | `core` | P2 | planned | No | Only relevant in split-preview mode |
| 14 | Custom keymap UI | `react` / `vue` + `core` | P2 | planned | Yes | Need to expose keymap register / query API first |

## 6. React / Vue SDK

| # | Feature | Package | Priority | Status | Needs OpenSpec | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | `<Editor />` container pass-through props + `onReady` callback | `react` (and `vue` in lockstep) | P0 | done | No | Full `HTMLAttributes` pass-through + `onReady`; react/vue in lockstep |
| 29 | Controlled document `value` / `v-model` | `react` + `vue` | P0 | done | No | Parent-owned markdown via silent `setDocument` sync; helpers in `controlled-document.ts` |

| 18 | Realtime collaboration (OT / CRDT) | new `plugin-collab` | P3 | planned | Yes | Large feature; start with a tech-selection design doc |
| 19 | Version history / snapshots | `core` + host storage | P2 | planned | Yes | electron-demo lands the reference impl first |
| 20 | Shared comments / @mention | new `plugin-annotation` | P3 | planned | Yes | Depends on #18 |

## 8. Cross-platform

| # | Feature | Package | Priority | Status | Needs OpenSpec | Notes |

## 9. Developer Experience

| 25 | End-to-end testing | repo infra | P1 | planned | No | Candidate: Playwright against electron-demo |
| 26 | CI/CD pipeline polish | `.github/workflows` | P1 | in-progress | No | PR check / CI and publish workflow exist; missing e2e gate |

## Maintenance

1. **Adding an item**: append a row in the matching section with the next number; mention it in the PR description.
2. **Status transitions**: start work → `in-progress`; merged → `done`; abandon → `dropped` (keep the row for traceability).
3. **Priority adjustments**: maintainers re-balance at each iteration kickoff — don't tweak priorities as drive-by edits in feature PRs.
4. **OpenSpec linkage**: once an item enters the OpenSpec flow, fill its `openspec/changes/<id>/` link into the row's "Notes" column.
